                  Keeping in view the importance of women empowerment in a
                  country like India, the Ministry of Women and Child
                  Development launched the Swayamsiddha Scheme in February 2001
                  in 238 blocks, around 35 states and UTs.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Government of India launched the noteworthy Swayamsiddha
                  Scheme in the year 2001- the year of women empowerment. This
                  scheme is a step ahead, towards the much-needed and deserved
                  empowerment of women and child development. Swayamsiddha is a
                  flagship programme of Ministry of Women and Child development
                  intended towards “holistic development of women”. It is an
                  Integrated Women Empowerment Programme (IWEP), launched in
                  February 2001 in 650 blocks including the 238 IMY blocks in 35
                  states / Union Territories (UT) with a total budget of
                  Rs.116.30 crores.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The scheme succeeded Indira Mahila Yojana (IMY), the first
                  Self-Help (SHG)-based women’s empowerment programme of
                  Ministry of WCD. Indira Mahila Yojana was launched in 1995-96
                  in 238 blocks in the country, and Rs.12.20 crores were
                  released to states under the scheme for the formation of Self
                  Help Groups, Clusters and Block Federations and related
                  training programmes. About 40000 SHGs were formed under IMY,
                  and the expenditure was Rs.7.20 crores. The scheme didn’t pan
                  out to be a great success because it had no structured
                  training programmes, and there was no provision for
                  monitoring, administrative expenses, etc. An improved version
                  of this was the Swayamsiddha scheme of 2001, which seeks to
                  empower women through series of programmes of awareness
                  generation, the achievement of economic strength through
                  micro-level income-generating activities and establish the
                  convergence of various service such as literacy, health, rural
                  development, etc. It also aims at organising women into
                  self-help groups to form a strong institutional base. It was
                  launched as the government recognised that women are equal
                  players in the economy, whether they participate directly as
                  workers or indirectly as numbers of the care economy. State
                  governments too are keen on giving equal importance and
                  opportunities to their women population. State’s focus is not
                  only restricted to conventional issues like education, health,
                  but it also involves other areas of public expenditure,
                  revenue and policy with a gender perspective. They also intend
                  to make women independent and self-reliant in every walk of
                  life. Vocational and professional training under the scheme
                  also help women and adolescent girls in starting
                  self-employment ventures.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Its long term objective is all-round empowerment of women
                  especially socially and economically, by ensuring them direct
                  access to and control over, resources through a sustained
                  process of mobilisation and convergence of all the on-going
                  sectoral programmes resulting in Creation of confidence and
                  awareness among members of SHGs regarding women’s status,
                  health, nutrition, education, sanitation and hygiene, legal
                  rights, economics upliftment and other social economic and
                  political issues, Strengthening and institutionalising the
                  savings habit in rural women and their control over economic
                  resources.

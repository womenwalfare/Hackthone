                  promotes girls education in the state. This scheme is
                  implemented in both rural and urban areas.The finnancial
                  assistance through the scheme follows a certain manner the 1st

                  The Gujarat Government wants to ensure that every girl child
                  of the state should be adequate education. With the
                  implementation of this scheme, the Government will offer
                  financial assistance to the parents of female students as they
                  receive the amount to send their girls to school. This scheme
                  eliminates the social evils in the society and helps the girls
                  with a better standard of living. Under this project, the
                  Gujarat government has promised financial assistance of
                  Rs.1,10,000 to every applicant who becomes a registered
                  beneficiary. The full amount will be deposited in the
                  beneficiaries accounts in three separate instalments. The
                  beneficiaries will get the subsidy in their account at the
                  fixed time frame by the government. In the recent Gujarat
                  Budget 2019-20, the state government has allocated Rs.133
                  crore for Vahli Dikri Yojana. This scheme aims to create
                  sustainable growth of all these people that further helps with
                  improving their standard of living in society. When the girl
                  will take admission in class 1, then the sum of Rs. 4000 will
                  be credited to her account. Again, when she successfully
                  completes the 8th standard examination and gets admission in
                  9th standard, the government will credit her account with
                  Rs.6000. After completing and passing the examination of class
                  12, the Gujarat government will make the transfer of Rs.1 lakh
                  in the bank accounts of the respective beneficiaries. The
                  registered beneficiary will be able to withdraw the sum of
                  Rs.1 lakh from her bank account once she attains the legal age
                  of 18 years. She is free to use the funds for vocational
                  training, higher education or to meet the expenses of
                  marriage.

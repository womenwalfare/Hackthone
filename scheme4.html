                  Kanya Kelavani Yojana is a step taken by the Gujarat
                  government to promote education for girls with the vision to
                  increase the female literacy ratio in the state. To prevent
                  the dropout ratios due to financial reasons, the scheme is
                  providing financial aid to the girls by bearing the education
                  fees. The scheme falls under the MYSY scholarship and is given
                  additional benefits under Kanya Kelavani Yojana.

                  The Kanya Kelavani is the move in the right direction for
                  ‘Education for All.’ A flagship program of the Government
                  entered the ninth year encouraging formal education with
                  special focus on the girls, amidst celebratory claims of 0%
                  dropout rates being attained in several districts in Gujarat.

                  The journey that began a decade ago shows signs of success
                  with more and more enrolment in schools around the state, and
                  a marked increase in literacy Hon’ble Chief Minister Narendra
                  Modi led Team Gujarat - the entire Council of Ministers,
                  Member of Parliaments and all Secretaries, besides other
                  officers and people's representatives joined in the campaign
                  to bring a change. Team Gujarat that headed out in different
                  directions, carried the message of education, trying to
                  convince the parents to put their child in school and ensuring
                  they stay there, as the Government aims to increase an all
                  round stature of living across the state. Team Gujarat’s
                  campaign in 2011 covered 32,772 primary schools in all the
                  18,000 villages, 151 municipalities and eight municipal
                  corporations during the 9th Kanya Kelavani Yatra (Girls'
                  Education) and Shala Praveshotsav Abhiyan (School Enrolment
                  Movement) The movement was held in two phases in rural and
                  Urban Gujarat. 16th, 17th and 18th June, the campaign covered
                  rural Gujarat, and repeating the exercise in it’s urban leg
                  23rd, 24th and 25th of the same month.

                  The change isn’t a miracle but since 2003, the state machinery
                  has worked tirelessly to put in place schemes and trusts to
                  cover all basics needed to bring in much needed behavioral
                  change to alter the life cycle of citizens around the state.
                  All public officials, including the government's
                  highest-ranking officials visited pre-assigned territories,
                  covering schools, in what has now become a customary exercise
                  in the calendar.
